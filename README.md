# TBotD
A simple, shoddily-written Discord bot. This was, frankly speaking, my first 'real' coding project, so do not expect any high quality code, or any best practices when it comes to SQL.

## Primary Features
- Allows users to blind themselves from channels for a given amount of time.
- Allows users to set themselves reminders
- Fixing Twitter links
- Notifying when a new thread is created
- Various minor tasks, some for the purpose of moderation, some recreational

## Current State
Still running, never crashed, and never dropped any reminders or delayed tasks!
